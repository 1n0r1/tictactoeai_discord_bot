# tictactoeAI_discord_bot
A tic-tac-toe bot that can play tic-tac-toe with you when you have no friend.
Has 3 difficulty levels:
  
  level 0: purely random moves
  
  level 1: can recognize a winning move and play the move, or block the winning move from you
  
  level 2: unbeatable? (still not sure about this)

&start <level: 0 - 2> : start the game

&move <position: 1 - 9> : move 

&show_board : show the current game again
